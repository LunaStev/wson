## Installation

You can install WSON using pip:

```bash
pip install wson
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use WSON in your Python projects:

```python
import wson

# WSON String
wson_data = """
{
    status = "success",
    code = 200,
    message = "Data retrieved successfully",

    user = {
        id = 123,
        name = "John Doe",
        email = "john@example.com",
        age = 25
    },

    tasks = [
        {
            task_id = 1,
            title = "Complete project report",
            status = "in-progress",
            due_date = "2024-10-15"
        },
        {
            task_id = 2,
            title = "Review team feedback",
            status = "pending",
            due_date = "2024-10-20"
        }
    ]
}
"""

# Parsing the WSON string into the Python dictionary
parsed_data = wson.loads(wson_data)
print("Parsed Data:")
print(parsed_data)

# Serialize Python dictionaries into WSON strings
wson_output = wson.dumps(parsed_data)
print("\nSerialized WSON:")
print(wson_output)
```

## Why WSON?

WSON addresses some limitations of JSON and YAML:

1. Unlike JSON, WSON supports comments, making it more readable and self-documenting.
2. WSON has a simpler syntax compared to YAML, reducing the chance of indentation errors.
3. WSON preserves the original formatting when possible, unlike JSON which often alters the structure.
4. WSON is more concise than JSON, omitting unnecessary quotation marks for keys.
